# Project: Obama-Clinton Case Study and NICU Case Study
This repository contains two case studies: the Obama-Clinton case study and the NICU case study.

## Obama-Clinton Case Study

### Section 1: The Problem
The Obama-Clinton case study focuses on the segmentation of voters based on demographic data. The goal is to understand voting patterns and generate insights for future predictions.

### Section 2: Understand the Data
This section describes the nature, size, and source of the data used in the case study. It also highlights the key attributes related to the sub-problems, such as wealth and age.

S### ection 3: Prepare the Data
The data preparation steps, including handling missing values and creating suitable training and testing subsets, are explained in this section.

### Section 4: Generate and Test Prediction Model
This section discusses the prediction models used, including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Regression Tree. The models are evaluated using different predictors and attribute configurations.

### Section 5: Problem Conclusions and Recommendations
In this section, the conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis of the case study are presented. It includes insights into the best prediction model and suggestions for campaign strategies.

## NICU Case Study
The NICU case study focuses on analyzing US births data to provide recommendations regarding the expansion of NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit).

### Preparing the Data
This section explains the process of preparing the data for analysis, including creating time-series plots and observing seasonal trends.

### Forecasting and Analysis
The forecasting models, Holt's linear trend model and Additive seasonality model, are used to generate forecasts for the number of US births. The analysis includes comparing the models' performance and examining the seasonality patterns in births, NICU Average Length of Stay (ALOS), and NICU admission.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided regarding the allocation of resources and the expansion of NICU.
